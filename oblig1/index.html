            <h2>Semi-automatic gears</h2>
            <p>
              Race cars have used conventional gearboxes since they began, but
              after Porsche introduced the direct shift gearbox in 1984 for the
              Porsche 962, which allowed shifting without a clutch, this
              technology has evolved into paddle shifters on the steering wheel.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although paddle shifters are not as widespread and common as once
              expected, they are still widely available in many cars and are
              often an optional feature that can be ordered in many new
              petrol-powered cars.

            <h2>Disc Brakes</h2>
            <p>
              Originally, brake discs were introduced by Porsche in the 24 Hours
              of Le Mans race, and since then, they have been implemented in
              almost all everyday cars since the 1980s.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since it is now possible to brake without locking the steering
              wheel, this has impacted both the safety and efficiency of the
              brakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over time, there has been a shift away from standard steel brakes,
              which are most common in regular cars, toward ceramic brakes in
              cars that require lighter materials and better heat resistance, a
              feature often needed in race cars and the fastest road cars.

            <h2>Rear View Mirrors</h2>
            <p>
              Even though we may take the rearview mirror for granted, it wasnâ€™t
              always present. Since its introduction, the rearview mirror has
              become a must-have feature, providing much better safety and
              visibility in almost every situation on the road.

            <h2>Is the influence relevant?</h2>
            <p>
              Motorsport innovations, such as the direct shift gearbox, paddle
              shifters, brake discs, and ceramic brakes, have significantly
              influenced everyday car technology, enhancing both performance and
              safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              Features like the rearview mirror, now standard in all vehicles,
              continue to improve driver awareness and road safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though some technologies have not become as widespread as
              initially expected, many have become essential or high-performance
              options in modern vehicles.
